# Student-Performance-Monitor
✅ Tracks student attendance and assignment scores
✅ Flags students falling below a performance threshold
✅ Auto-sends alerts to teachers and parents via WhatsApp (Twilio)
✅ Optional Slack notifications for institutions and mentors
✅ Uses Google Forms for input, Google Sheets for logic, and Apps Script + Twilio for automation

This tool was designed with real classrooms in mind — it works without heavy infrastructure and can be customized by any teacher or school using free tools.

🛠️ Tech Stack / Tools Used:
📋 Google Forms – for collecting attendance, test scores, homework logs
📊 Google Sheets – for storing data, calculating scores, and setting alert conditions
🤖 Google Apps Script – to automate logic, filter low performers, and trigger messages
📞 Twilio API (WhatsApp) – for instant parent/teacher notifications
💬 Slack Bot Integration – for internal academic alerts to staff

🌱 Why This Project Matters:
As a BCA Full Stack Development student, I wanted to explore how low-code tools and automation can solve real educational problems. Many schools lack complex software — but with a few smart integrations, we can build AI-like behavior on top of everyday tools.

This solution is:
✅ Lightweight
✅ Scalable
✅ Real-time
✅ Customizable for any grade/class

🔮 What’s Next:
📈 Add visual dashboards with Google Data Studio
🧠 Integrate AI predictions for performance drops
🔐 Add Google Workspace login access control
🌐 Package it as a plug-and-play template for schools
